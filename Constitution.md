<h2>Definition of LAARD and history</h2>
LAARD stands for Lipid Analysis for Archaeological Research Development. We are a community of researchers from around the world focusing on the lipid analysis of archaeological samples.
We aim to openly share knowledge and experience to find solutions to common challenges and obstacles that the field faces, primarily within online community spaces (Element). We run various collaborative projects for the benefit of the whole community and to progress the field including a biannual conference for early career researchers. We have various events throughout the year with cycling steering committees to improve networking.
The idea of LAARD originated in 2023 during the International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology biannual conference in Tartu, Estonia and was inspired by the communities built by <a href="https://www.spaam-community.org/about/">SPAAM</a>, <a href="https://haam-community.github.io/">HAAM</a> and <a href="https://paasta-community.github.io/about/">PAASTA</a>. It has been designed to be an open, supportive community led by early career researchers to promote collaborative and open science within lipid analysis of archaeological samples. We have been associated with the International Society of Biomolecular Archaeology since our inception in 2024.
<h2>Location</h2>
Our main community space is Element. We also gather in-person for biannual conferences and online for various events. We keep information about the community archived on our website, along with information on how to get involved.
<h2>Membership</h2>
We welcome all early stage career researchers, as well as Principal Investigators (PIs) and other senior researchers, to join our community by contacting the Committee through our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrmI_n_aEAr3qw6m5bFx1NyG1izryU3uJroSrS5PDpH_teNA/viewform?usp=sf_link">form</a>. However, the community is intended to be especially beneficial to early career researchers; thus, we encourage PIs not to monopolise discussions.

All members of our community are obliged to follow our <a href="https://laardcommunity.github.io/Code-of-Conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. Before joining the community, be sure to read and understand what this entails.

<h2>Finances</h2>
There is no membership fee to join the LAARD community. However, opportunities for voluntary donations will be presented in community-wide LAARD meetings. We are financially supported by voluntary donations from members and research group leaders.

<h2>Constitution</h2>
The constitution (this document) outlines the structure and information about the LAARD community. The constitution is a living document which will be updated as needed to fit the needs of the LAARD community. It is primarily maintained by the Steering Committee, but other members can make suggestions by reaching out to the Steering Committee and advocate for changes as they see fit.
<h1>LAARD Steering Committee</h1>
<h2>Definition - Steering Committee</h2>
The Steering Committee is an executive board that manages the daily operations of the community and provides support, guidance and oversight of particular issues or projects within the context of the LAARD community.
The tasks of the Steering Committee involve brainstorming, proposing new initiatives and helping these get off the ground, by increasing engagement and support for LAARD members and events, helping with ongoing organisation efforts and publicization of LAARD, and sourcing funds for the maintenance of LAARD.
The Steering Committee is formed by teams consisting of the managing team: a chair, a co-chair/treasurer and a secretary, a social media team and an engagement team. The teams meet on a regular basis to divide responsibilities and set up a communication method that ensures tasks are fulfilled.
<h2>Description of the Roles</h2>
<h3>Management team</h3>
Formed by the Chair, the Vice-Chair/Treasurer and the Secretary. Responsible for ensuring the committee functions smoothly and achieves its goals.

<u>Chair</u>: The one to lead meetings, sets agendas, moderates discussions and delegates tasks to volunteer members. It represents the LAARD community in any official meetings or interviews. They are also responsible for having an overview of the various initiatives by  working closely with the communication and engagement teams. The Chair allows for discussion around long-term topics, and needs to be forward thinking on this end.

<u>Vice-Chair/Treasurer</u>: Supports the Chair and fills in when the Chair is unavailable. Distribution of work can be discussed between the Chair and Vice-Chair. The role of Treasurer is taken by the Vice-Chair. The treasurer is responsible for managing the funds available. They will also manage communications related to funds and will hold responsibility for allocating funding to initiatives by serving as a line of communication between the organising committees and the Steering Committee. The treasurer is also responsible for leading on grant applications to continue to fund LAARD initiatives.

<u>Secretary</u>: Responsible for taking minutes during Committee and general meetings, sending them out to the community via Element when they are ready, and making sure that assignments are noted. Organisational responsibilities (i.e. keeping google docs in order, annotating the minutes with required links, possibly doing the same for the agenda ahead of time).

*note that the Chair, and Vice-Chair and Secretary need to come from different institutions.
<h3>Communication team</h3>
Responsible for the outreach of the community, by tweeting (with the Twitter/X account <a href="https://x.com/LAARD_community">(@laard_community)</a>, emailing as well as updating the website. Social media officers will announce new initiatives, conferences, new publications papers and job opportunitiess that are relevant for the LAARD community.
<h3>Events and Engagement team</h3>
Responsible for coming up with new initiatives (projects, summer schools, outreach activities, etc.) and proposing them to the community. They will also oversee ongoing initiatives and provide support for them to reach their goals. They will ensure that the initiative is known both inside and outside the community by working together with the communications team. Suggesting potential funding sources for the initiative, by engaging with the treasurer, will also be part of their role. Organising the event with support from the LAARD board. 
<h2>Time in Office</h2>
Any member of the Steering Committee is elected for 2 years. After the first two years since the foundation of LAARD, half of the Steering Committee will be replaced by a new election every year. At that time, those who remain on the Steering Committee will be able to change roles. This implies that, exceptionally, three members of the first Steering Committee will be active for 3 years.
<h2>How are Steering Committee members chosen?</h2>
Community members will be encouraged to volunteer when the term for the current Steering Committee is reaching an end. If a team lacks volunteers, the current officers will nominate a person to substitute them. The committee should include at least one PhD student and one post-doctoral/early-career researcher. The roles will be attributed between members of the Steering Committee at the first Steering Committee meeting. 
<h2>Amending the Constitution</h2>
Any member can propose amendments they wish to see to the Constitution by contacting either the Chair or Vice-Chair. Proposed changes will be reviewed by the Steering Committee and voted on by the community during a general meeting.
