<h2>Quick Summary</h2>
LAARD is a community of researchers from around the world focusing on the lipid analysis of archaeological samples. This community is affiliated with the International Society of Biomolecular Archaeology (ISBA). 
Our primary community space is on Element, and we organise biannual in-person conferences and other online events.
- All career stages are invited, but the emphasis is on providing a welcoming space for early-career researchers.
We facilitate a variety of initiatives to support the community, from classes to informal meetings and seminars,
LAARD initiatives and events are supported by a Steering Committee but are often led by LAARD members; please contact the Committee if you have ideas or are interested in helping,
LAARD membership is free, but donations may be sought during the annual meeting â€“ and if you are interested in supporting LAARD financially, please reach out to the treasurer!
<h2>Definition of LAARD and history</h2>
LAARD stands for Lipid Analysis for Archaeological Research Development. We are a community of researchers from around the world focusing on the lipid analysis of archaeological samples.
We aim to openly share knowledge and experience to find solutions to common challenges and obstacles that the field faces, primarily within online community spaces (Element). We run various collaborative projects for the benefit of the whole community and to progress the field including a biannual conference for early career researchers. We have various events throughout the year with cycling steering committees to improve networking.
The idea of LAARD originated in 2023 during the International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology biannual conference in Tartu, Estonia and was inspired by the communities built by SPAAM, HAAM and PAASTA. It has been designed to be an open, supportive community led by early career researchers to promote collaborative and open science within lipid analysis of archaeological samples. We have been associated with the International Society of Biomolecular Archaeology since our inception in 2024.
