<p>Triacylglycerols, plant sterols, and terpenoids are valuable biomarkers in Organic Residue Analysis. They are generally well preserved within porous unglazed ceramics due to their hydrophobic and chemically stable nature, which help prevent leaching and microbial breakdown. The entrapment and retention of these residues are influenced by the ceramic matrix’s porosity and composition and recent studies have highlighted the potential role of calcium carbonate, commonly used as a temper in archaeological ceramics, in lipid retention and extraction.<sup>1,2</sup> The amount of calcium carbonate present could lead to differential recovery of lipids and thus bias the extracted lipidic profile.</p>
<p>Our project combines traditional mineralogical characterization methods (XRD, XRF, SEM-EDX, Hg μporosimetry) with AFM-IR<sup>3</sup>, which allows for precise mapping of residues within ceramic matrices, to investigate the influence of the ceramic matrix on lipid extraction. Additionally, we are constructing a reliable model of the cooking processes in different ceramic matrices, in view of obtaining detailed temperature profiles. This will enable to work with a broader dataset and a better understanding of the thermal history of archaeological ceramics, further refining our ability to interpret artefact use and cultural practices.</p>
