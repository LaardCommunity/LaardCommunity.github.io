<p>The appearance of the Corded Ware Culture across many areas of Central and Northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BC was a major period of cultural transition, which has been linked to a series of human migrations from the Pontic-Caspian steppe region. Some previous zooarchaeological work has indicated that this also may have been a time of economic and agricultural change, with intensification of cattle husbandry. It is not known, however, how widespread this shift was, its exact nature or whether or not it is linked to the arrival of new human groups into the region. This paper will present extensive lipid residue analysis on pot and foodcrust samples to examine the use of pottery across the transition to Corded Ware in two regions: The Netherlands and Switzerland. This work shows an increase in dairy residues in Corded Ware pottery in both regions The results will be presented alongside zooarchaeological work investigating evidence for changes in animal husbandry at this time.</p>
