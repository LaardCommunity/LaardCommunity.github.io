We are "Lipid Analysis for Archaeological Research Development" (LAARD), a collective of scholars focused on the analysis of ancient lipid residues resulting from human activities.

Our mission at LAARD is to cultivate a welcoming and collaborative atmosphere for researchers in the field of lipid residue analysis. We strive to encourage inquiry, share knowledge, and champion the principles of open and cooperative science.
