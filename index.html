<h2>1st in person meeting</h2>
<p>The LAARD community will hold its first in-person meeting in Turin on Tuesday the 26th of August 2025, just before the start of the ISBA11 conference. To promote the visibility of as much work on lipids as possible, this day will be divided between the following activities:
