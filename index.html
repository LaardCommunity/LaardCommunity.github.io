<p>The LAARD community will hold its first in-person meeting in Turin on Tuesday the 26th of August 2025, just before the start of the ISBA11 conference. The event will take place in Aula 1 (morning) and Aula 2 (afternoon) in the Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, Via Accademia Albertina 13, Torino.
</p>
<p>Please note that this venue is different to the ones where the ISBA11 registration (Via Giuseppe Verdi 8) and cocktail reception (Piazza Castello 191) will take place. Each of these venues are about 10-12 min walk from each other.
</p>
<p>ISBA11 registration will open at 10.00 am and you must register before attending the welcome cocktail (18.00 pm). The LAARD1 programme is busy, but it should allow everyone to register after the discussions. We have also planned a 1.30-hour lunch break, which can be another opportunity to complete your registration.
</p>
<p>We kindly invite participants to <a href="https://laardcommunity.github.io/events/">register</a> and contribute to the catering costs. To make your contribution to the LAARD meeting (10€ for students and early career researchers, 15€ for others), please follow this link to <a href="https://www.isbarch.org/events/news/2025/04/29/events-laard-event.html">pay</a>.
